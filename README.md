# Team Profile Generator
In this assignment we were required to build and test 4 classes. Employee was the parent class of the Engineer, Intern, and Manager. We were then required to use jest to run the tests and ensure that they pass. We then were to use inquirer to ask the user questions in the terminal about their team. We used this information to build an HTML file with cards for each member of the team. We build the HTML file using a template.js file that held a card template for the employees and a general HTML template.
